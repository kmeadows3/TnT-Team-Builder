# Project Overview:

The idea behind this project is to make a Team Builder for the skirmish game
'This is Not a Test.' It should be able to build a team from scratch, adding individual 
units and tracking inventory across different units.

To start, a shortened version of the possible units, items, and traits will be used
to make sure the program is functional.

## Organization
 - The application will be the Builder
   - It will interact with the user through the terminal class
   - It will build a Team
   - It will add and remove units from the team
   - it calls inventory to add and remove items from either the team or the unit
 - Main classes
   - Team
     - Holds the entire team and tracks their state
   - Unit
     - holds individual team members and tracks their state
 - Other Utility Classes
   - Inventory
     - handles inventory management for units and teams
     - Also handles money?
   - Reference 
     - gets the data from the files (currently csv, might be able to upgrade later)
     - creates Reference object to store the data when we need to look up information
     - Array of lists? One for base units, one for items, one for traits?
   - Items (abstract)
     - creates items objects to stock inventory
     - subclasses: weapons, armor, equipment
   - Traits (abstract)
     - subclasses: skills, mutations, general

## Detailed Classes
 - ### Rulebook
   - Calls File Reader to make maps of the units, items, and traits
   - Variables
     - Units - holds unit map from File Reader
     - Weapons - holds map from file reader
     - Armor - holds map from file reader
     - Equipment - holds map from file reader
     - unitTrait - holds map from file reader
     - weapon trait - holds map from file reader
     - Rules (derived) - map of all of the variables, keyed to their key
   - Functions
     - Generate rulebook
       - Creates a rulebook object that contains variables to hold the maps generated by File Reader, keyed to the class types
     - Lookup method
       - Looks through all the maps to find a key that matches a given value, returns toString of object
       - Potentially requires Lookupable interface?
 - ### File Reader
    - Reads CSVs and creates reference object
    - Functions
      - Read line 
        - Output a list of Strings
      - Convert Unit
        - Makes map of units keyed to unit title
      - Convert Weapon
        - Makes a map of weapons keyed to weapon type
      - Convert Armor
        - Makes a map of armor keyed to armor type
      - Convert Equipment
        - makes a map of equipment keyed to equipment type
      - Convert Unit Trait
        - Makes a map of traits, keyed to trait name
      - Convert Weapon Trait
        - makes a map of traits, keyed to trait name
 - ### Team
   - Variables
     - Name
     - Faction
     - Money (bank object, then it can do bank functions)
     - Members (map of units, keyed to unit name)
     - Stock (List of items)
     - BS Cost (derived)
     - Relic Count (derived)
   - Functions
     - Add unit to team
     - Remove unit from team

       - Lose inventory
 - ### Unit
   - Variables
     - All Stats

       - potentially not needed, can be gained from Reference
     - EXP
       - Used
       - Unused
       - Next Level (derived)
       - Number of Advances (derived)
     - Relic count (derived)
